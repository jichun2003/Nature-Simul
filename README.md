# Nature-Simul

This project visualizes fluid-based natural phenomena such as vortices, smoke flow, and obstacle-driven turbulence using the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM).
The simulation is implemented in Python with matplotlib for interactive visualization, inspired by the excellent work of Dan Schroeder from Weber State University.

This project is a Python adaptation and extension of the ideas presented in:
